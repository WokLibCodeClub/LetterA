This project uses features of the Pygame Zero addition to Python to create a simple game which consists of moving letters about in a window.

The various steps cover window size and coordinates, control of the letters using if statements with keyboard input and rectangle objects.

In each step there will be challenges. You may be able to find possible solutions to these challenges by looking at code from the next step, but you'll learn much more about Python coding if you try to solve the challenges yourself first.
