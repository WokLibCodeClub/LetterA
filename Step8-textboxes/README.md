Pygame Zero has a lot of special functions for displaying objects in the game window.

We've already seen

```screen.draw.text``` which displays some text or a text variable and ```screen.draw.rect``` which draws a box.

But there are also

```screen.draw.filled_rectangle``` which draws a box and fills it with colour

```screen.draw.line``` which draws a line when you give it coordinates for the beginning and end

```screen.draw.circle``` which draws a circle when you give it the position and size

```screen.draw.filled_circle``` which draws a circle and fills it with colour

```screen.draw.blit``` which draws an image on the screen

You can find a complete list with all the necessary details at:

In this section we're going to use

```screen.draw.textbox``` which is very similar to ```screen.draw.rect``` but instead of drawing a box it fills the box with text or a text variable.
